# Watson-Beat
An OS X Desktop application for working [Watson Beat](https://github.com/cognitive-catalyst/watson-beat)

First you need to have [Watson Beat](https://github.com/cognitive-catalyst/watson-beat) installed and working.
Then you will need to update the code and point to where [Watson Beat](https://github.com/cognitive-catalyst/watson-beat) 
is installed.

The current application records from a piano on the MIDI input and then plays back the generated MIDI through the MIDI output.
You should set the ouptut MIDI device to different instruments for each channel up 15 channels.

Special thank you for [Michael Santos](https://github.com/michaelsantosus).  Couldn't have put this together so quickly and on time for the special event without his help.  Thanks for the late night help and laughs along the way.
